Upgrading to 0.5.x
------------------

* filters disappeared and changed into expression syntax: |eq, |ne, |lt,
  |gt, |not, etc.: adjust templates accordingly.

  e.g. {% if id|eq:2 %} becomes {% if id == 2 %}
  
* meaning of hassubject', 'hasobject', 'hassubjectpredicate' and 'hasobjectpredicate' has been reversed:
  m.search[{query hasobject=id}]           becomes  m.search[{query hassubject=id}]          (and reverse)
  m.search[{query hasobjectpredicate=id}]  becomes  m.search[{query hassubjectpredicate=id}] (and reverse)
* resource_staticfile's root dir has changed from site/templates/xx to site/xx
* m_group model no longer exists
